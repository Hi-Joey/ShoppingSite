Hi, this is Siyuan Liu, and this is the file that I added for the peer review of CS5010.  
In conclusion, you did a really good job! All functionalities required are completed and no bug during my test.
From my perspective, there might be something that you could do to improve:
1. I think it might be better that you put all the things needed in one page (which means no scroll button on the right side).
2. I noticed that if I add the same product for multiple times, instead of what we're familiar with when shopping on Amazon that the count of the same product increases, in your code, the same product appears multiple times on the shopping cart.
   Adding an attribute that counts the number of the same product and show it in the shopping cart would be better for the user experience.
